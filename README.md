## Hey there! 👋 I'm Xavier (xantoine-dev)

I'm a software developer based in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. I love building tools that make data more accessible and useful. My current focus is on Python backend development, data pipelines, and creating intuitive user interfaces.

- 🔬 I'm currently working on **self‑service data pipelines** and automation tools.
- 🌱 I'm learning more about **advanced Python**, **data engineering**, and **AI/ML**.
- 👥 I'm looking to collaborate on **open source Python projects** or anything data related.
- 💬 Ask me about **Python**, **Streamlit**, **pandas**, or building REST APIs.
- 📨 How to reach me: message me here on GitHub.

### ✨ Highlights

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

- [**yt_transcript_gui**](https://github.com/xantoine-dev/yt_transcript_gui) – A desktop tool for downloading YouTube subtitles/transcripts with a user-friendly interface.
- [**Amex-Acumatica Self-Service**](https://github.com/xantoine-dev/amex-acumatica-selfservice) – A Streamlit app to convert American Express statements into a format that Acumatica’s self‑service imports can process.
- [**Personal Website**](https://github.com/xantoine-dev/xantoine-dev.github.io) – My personal website and portfolio built with HTML/CSS/JS.
