# 👋 Hello there!

I'm Xavier, a software engineer based in Rancho Santa Margarita, California with a passion for building accessible user interfaces, automation tools, and data‑driven applications. I care deeply about developer experience, design systems, and crafting inclusive products that solve real‑world problems.

In my free time you'll often find me learning new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or tinkering with hardware projects. I believe in open knowledge and strive to write clean, well‑documented code that others can learn from.

## 🔥 Highlighted Projects

Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of. They demonstrate a variety of technical skills including front‑end component design, data automation, and desktop application development.

- **Password Toggle Field** – A fully accessible React password field with built‑in show/hide functionality. It exposes a straightforward API, handles keyboard navigation, and includes proper ARIA attributes for screen reader support. Available on npm for easy installation.
