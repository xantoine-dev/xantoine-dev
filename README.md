# Hello there!

I'm Xavier, a software engineer based in Rancho Santa Margarita, California with a passion for building accessible user interfaces, automation tools, and data‑driven applications. I care deeply about delivering high-quality software and improving developer experience over time.

In my free time you'll often find me learning new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or tinkering with hardware projects. I believe in open knowledge and strive to write clean, well-documented code that's a pleasure to work with.

## Highlighted Projects

Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of. They demonstrate a variety of technical skills including front‑end component design, data automation, and desktop application development.

- **Log Compiler** – An advanced tool designed for compiling and analyzing system logs with efficiency and clarity. The log compiler simplifies complex datasets, providing actionable insights with an intuitive interface and robust search capabilities. Developed with a focus on scalability and performance, it serves as an indispensable utility for developers and IT professionals.
- **Amex‑Acumatica Self‑Service** – A Streamlit application that cleans and exports American Express transaction data for ingestion into Acumatica ERP. It provides a simple point‑and‑click interface to save valuable time in financial workflows.
- **yt_transcript_gui** – A cross‑platform desktop app that lets you download and organize YouTube transcripts. Built with Electron and powered by the youtube‑transcript‑api, it supports multiple export formats and robust tagging.
- **Personal Website** – A personal portfolio built with HTML/CSS/JS. [GitHub](https://github.com/xantoine-dev/xantoine-dev.github.io)
